class DomainModel(Protocol):
    """
    Abstract interface for domain model.

    A `SimulationContext` provides all entities in the system with access to simulation-wide state including other
    entities, signals, transactions, and boundaries. It also exposes methods for recording signal events and
    subscribing to changes in the system's execution history. All entities in the simulation use the global signal logs
    in the SimulationContext to record :class: `SignalEvents`.

    Other classes such as boundaries also maintain signal logs, but they are expected to register for SignalEvents with
    the global signal log.

    Concrete simulation classes are expected to implement this interface to support analysis,
    monitoring, and coordination across subsystems. See :class:`sim.runtime.Simulation` for a concrete
    implementation.

    ### Example

    ```python
    class MySim(SimulationContext):
        def entities(self, name: str) -> List[Entity]:
            return self.entity_registry.get(name, [])

        def record_signal(self, source, timestamp, signal_type, signal, transaction=None, target=None, tags=None):
            return self.timeline.record(source, timestamp, signal_type, signal, transaction, target, tags)

        @property
        def all_logs(self) -> List[SignalLog]:
            return [self.timeline]
    ```
    """
