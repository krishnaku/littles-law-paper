class Timescale:
    """
    Timescale represents a partition of a continuous time interval [t0, t1)
    into a fixed number of equal-width bins, where each bin spans `bin_width` time units.

    This class provides utility methods for:
    - Mapping continuous time values to discrete bin indices
    - Retrieving the time boundaries of bins
    - Determining which bins are touched by a time interval
    - Computing the fractional overlap of an interval with a specific bin

    It is the foundational object used in constructing presence matrices, allowing
    continuous presence intervals to be consistently and accurately projected onto
    a discrete time grid for analysis or visualization.
