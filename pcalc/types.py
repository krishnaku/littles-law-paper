"""
Presence matrices created from Boundary presences are Boolean: they indicate
whether or not an element was present in a boundary over a time interval. This is the base case 
for presence based flow analytics and represented by the type `BooleanPresence`. 

We may also apply functions to boolean presence matrix to transform it into a matrix
over the reals. In these cases, we will represent the resulting 
matrix using the type `RealPresence`.

The type variable `T_Matrix` represents the union of all possible matrix types.
