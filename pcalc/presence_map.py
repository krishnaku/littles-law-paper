    """A presence map is a mapping of a presence, which has
    a start and end time on a continuous timescale, to a
    discrete timescale where a continuous interval from t0 to t1 is
    divided into equal-sized bins of width `bin_width`.

    A presence map is a piecewise constant function over the bin indices,
    where the presence is assumed to be:

    - zero outside the mapped bin range,
    - possibly fractional (0 < p < 1) in the first and last bins due to partial overlap, and
    - equal to 1.0 in all interior bins that fall entirely within the presence interval.

    This representation allows the continuous duration of a presence
    to be projected onto a discrete matrix without loss of precision
    at the boundaries, while enabling efficient matrix-based analytics and transformations.
